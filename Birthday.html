        <p>Happy birthday to my special gem,the best boyfriend one could ever get .I am so proud to have such a handsome, charming and selfless person in my life. I  promise to make you the happiest man in the world. </p>
        <p>You bring me happiness that no one else ever could. You brought me the love that I have never known before. All the surprises,all the love,i can never take anything you do to me for granted. I cannot imagine my life without you. I wake up and sleep thinking about you and I am always thankful to God for you because you are my answered prayer. You have given me so much within a very short time. You have always been there for me when I feel lost or down and that makes me feel safe when I have you by my side. I love you so much and I feel so blessed that you became part of my life and I cannot wait for the time I’ll get to see you .You have such a good heart ,always there for people and always trying to help. I really admire so many things about you and I feel lucky to call you mine. I love the fact that you don’t judge someone from their past and honestly,this is one thing that made me fall more in love with you and I got more comfortable telling you stuffs (something that scares me so much).You are so unique from very many men out here. Like I always say you are among the 1% good men that exist. Since the time you came into my world,i have learned so so much . I never thought I would find such a nice soul but God works miracles. You are my happiness. You are so hardworking and determined and I really admire that. Kina Almasi will be so lucky to have you as their dad. You are the only person who has been able to understand me and always there for me no matter what .When I see your call,i  am always smiling because I know that I have someone who’s always thinking of me. I love you so much and I don’t know what I could do without you. You make me feel like I am the only girl in  the world. Stay with me forever baby because my World will be incomplete without you. I will spoil you,encourage you,support you and do all that it takes to make you happy. Like you always tell me,“WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER BABY”, yeees sweetheart,till the world comes to an end sweetheart, I’ll be stuck with you  in good and bad times. You are so selfless  my love ,something so rare to find. I want to wake up next to you,make breakfast with you,shower with you,watch movies with you,hold your hand while we walk together, buy you gifts to appreciate you, wear your hoodies hahaha… ,cook together..baby the list is endless. The future is so bright with you in my life. You make me believe that there are really good things in this World and all I have to do is make an effort to get them. Baby you made believe that there’s truly an unlocked door just waiting for me to open it. US FOREVER SWEETHEART. You hold me and always assure me that everything is going to be okay even when I feel like I want to give up.</p>
        <p>I cannot exhaust everything you are to me in words but baby you are my life. I  promise to always love you and always hold you in my heart because you are my forever. I will always be here for you when you need me and I will love you no matter what life brings us. You are my better-half  and I vow to love you forever. I love you so so much baby and I miss you.
          May we grow old together sweetheart and celebrate more birthdays . I wish you were here we celebrate it together. But I hope that you will have a good one there and always remember that I love you so much and will always be there. To more happiness,more love and more laughter. I LOVE YOU FOREVER MY LOVE.
